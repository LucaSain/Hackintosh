1 FOLLOW THE DORTANIA CABY LAKE LAPTOP GUIDE, 
2 OPTIMUS SO NO NVIDIA GPU
3 DONT FORGET TO GENERATE SMBIOS, IF YOU ARE USING MY CONFIG MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE SMBIOS
4 IF YOU ENCOUNTER ERRORS IN ACPI , MY TRACKPAD PATCH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH YOURS,
USE THE ACPI PATCH FROM https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-catalina-on-asus-fx503vd.257815/  (THERE IS SPECIFIED WHICH PATCH FROM HIS FOLDER IS FOR TRACKPAD)
5 BATTERY PERCENTAGE IS STILL NOT WORKING, (this is my first OpenCore Hackintosh so donâ€™t blame on me, Iam still dumb)
6 IF YOU ARE MAKING CHANGES TO OC FOLDER, REMEMBER TO SNAPSHOT WITH PROPER TREE(useful thing)
